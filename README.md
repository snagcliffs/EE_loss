### Output-weighted and relative entropy loss functions for deep learning precursors of extreme events

Samuel H. Rudy and Themistoklis P. Sapsis

#### Overview

Software used for study of loss functions with specific aim of accuratley predicting and quantifying extreme events.

#### Requires

Python version 3.5+
Minimal python requirements: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow 2, tensorflow-probability, GPy, numba

Dataset generation requires installation of Nek5000 and dependencies.  Run time for Kolmogorov flow simulation is approximately 5 hours on 16 cores and square cylinder is approximately 43.5 hours on 128 cores.  Mesh generation uses gmsh.

#### Data Access

Data files are stored using git large file storage.  To download, install git-lfs, clone repository, and use "git-lfs pull".
