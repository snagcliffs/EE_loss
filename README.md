### Output-weighted and relative entropy loss functions for deep learning precursors of extreme events in fluid flows

Samuel H. Rudy and Themistoklis P. Sapsis

#### Overview

Software used for study of loss functions with specific aim of accuratley predicting and quantifying extreme events.

#### Requires

Python version 3.5+
Minimal python requirements: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tensorflow 2, tensorflow-probability, GPy, numba

Dataset generation requires installation of Nek5000 and dependencies.  Run time for Kolmogorov flow simulation is approximately ??? hours on ??? cores and square cylinder is approximately ??? hours on 128 cores.  Mesh generation uses gmsh.
